Use Query Converter Test Bench to test SQL statements 
and stored procedures converted by :ref:`rm-query-converter`. 
Relational Migrator uses the connections defined for your 
source and destination databases and allows you to run 
the original and converted queries or stored procedures. 
The results from each are displayed on the Query Converted 
Test Bench allowing a side-by-side comparison of the results.

Use Cases
---------

Query Converted Test Bench allows you to:

- Compare your original and converted results 
  conveniently in a single place.
- Increase your confidence in resources automatically 
  converted by the Query Converter.
- See potential logic errors and edit the converted 
  code before moving to production.

Get Started
-----------

To get started, see :ref:`rm-compare-converted-queries`.
