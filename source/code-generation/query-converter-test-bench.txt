Use Query Converter Test Bench to test SQL statements 
and stored procedures converted by :ref:`rm-query-converter`. 
Relational Migrator uses the connections defined for your 
source and destination databases and runs the original and 
converted queries or stored procedures within Relational
Migrator. The results from each query are displayed on the 
test bench GUI.

Use Cases
---------

Query Converted Test Bench allows you to:

- Compare your original and converted results 
  conveniently in a single place.
- Increase your confidence in assets automatically 
  converted by the :ref:`rm-query-converter`.
- See potential logic errors and edit the converted 
  resource before moving them to production.
