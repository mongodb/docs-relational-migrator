Use Query Converter Test Bench to test SQL queries 
and stored procedures converted by :ref:`rm-query-converter`. 
Query Converter Test Bench uses the project's source 
and destination database connections and allows you to
run the original SQL and converted MongoDB code.
The results from each query are displayed on the Query Converter 
Test Bench, allowing for a side-by-side comparison.

Use Cases
---------

Query Converted Test Bench allows you to:

- Compare your original and converted 
  query results in a single place.
- Increase your confidence in code automatically 
  converted by the query converter.
- See potential logic errors and edit the converted 
  code before moving it to production.

Requirements
------------

To use Query Converter Test Bench, you must 
run the Query Runner Docker container. This 
container can be run locally or hosted remotely. 
For details, see :ref:`rm-install-query-runner`.
