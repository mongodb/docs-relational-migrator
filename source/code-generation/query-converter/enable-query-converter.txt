You can use the query converter to convert SQL statements, views, and 
stored procedures to MongoDB syntax. The query converter considers the 
mapping rules and schema transformations defined in your project when 
converting your SQL code.

Before You Begin
----------------

Before you can use the query converter, you must sign in to your Atlas
account in {+rel-mig+}. For details, see :ref:`rm-atlas-log-in`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Navigate to the query converter pane

      From the :guilabel:`Code Generation` tab, click the 
      :guilabel:`Query Converter` pane.

   .. step:: Read the user agreement

   .. step:: (Optional) Review telemetry preferences

      Telemetry data about the source and converted queries are 
      temporarily stored by MongoDB to improve the query converter 
      feature. If you do not want your data to be stored, you have 
      the option to opt out:

      .. include:: /includes/fact-disable-query-converter.rst

   .. step:: Enable the query converter feature

      Click :guilabel:`Start Using Query Converter`. 
      The :guilabel:`Query Converter` pane is displayed.
