You can use the query converter test bench to compare SQL queries
and converted MongoDB queries inside of Relational Migrator. 
Query converter test bench can help you verify the accuracy 
of each converted query.

Before You Begin
----------------

- `Install Docker <https://www.docker.com/>`.

- Query Converter Test Bench requires the language converter 
  runtime Docker container to be running on your system. 
  The language convert runs serveral endpoints on 
  port ``6080``. These endpoints contain the logic and 
  dependencies required to convert and run source and 
  destination queries. 

- Before you can use the query converter test bench, you must 
  sign in to your Atlas account in Relational Migrator. For 
  details, see :ref:`rm-atlas-log-in`.

- For details on how to turn on query converter, see 
  :ref:`rm-enable-query-converter`.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::
   :style: normal

   .. step:: Start the Relational Migrator Query Runner

      The Query Runner is a Docker container that runs custom REST endpoints.
      These endpoints are used to convert and run source and destination queries.
   
      .. code-block::

         docker run --name relational-migrator-query-runner -p 6080:6080 public.ecr.aws/v4d7k6c9/relational-migrator-query-runner

   .. step:: Navigate to the query converter pane

      From the :guilabel:`Code Generation` tab, click the 
      :guilabel:`Query Converter` pane.

   .. step:: Open the query test bench console

      Click the :icon-lg:`ChevronUp` on the :guilabel:`Test Queries`
      pane at the bottom-right of the screen.

   .. step:: Run the source query

      a. On the :guilabel:`Test Queries`
         pane, click the :guilabel:`Run Source Query` 
         button.

      #. Enter the connection details to your source database.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Run` on the 
         :guilabel:`Connection Details` form.

         The data from the source database populates in 
         :guilabel:`Results`.

         .. note::

            You can click the :guilabel:`Messages` pill to 
            see execution statistics such as ``Execution Time``
            and ``Row Count``.
      
   .. step:: Run the converted query

      a. On the :guilabel:`Test Queries`
         pane, click :guilabel:`Run Converted Query` 
         button.

      #. Enter the connection details to your database.

      #. Click :guilabel:`Run` on the 
         :guilabel:`Connection Details` form.

         The data from the destination database populates 
         on the right-side of :guilabel:`Results`.

         .. note::

            You can click the :icon-lg:`Menu` and 
            :icon-lg:`Apps` buttons to switch between 
            the document and row view for the data. 

   .. step:: Compare the results of the source and destination queries
