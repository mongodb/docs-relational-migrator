Relational Migrator uses JDBC connection strings and associated user
credentials to access your relational database and MongoDB deployment.
You can save this information as a database connection.

Use Cases
---------

You can save connection settings for relational and MongoDB databases
when creating projects and migration jobs. You can use these saved database
connections for any task that requires connecting to a relational or MongoDB
database.

To create, view, and manage saved connections, go to the Relational 
Migrator :guilabel:`Connections` page.
