You can save connection settings for both relational and MongoDB databases, so
that you don't have to enter them repeatedly. You can use saved connection
information for any task that requires connecting to a relational or MongoDB
database.

You can save this information as a new Connection in the Relational Migrator
:guilabel:`Connections` UI, or as a :ref:`connection string
<rm-connection-strings>`.
