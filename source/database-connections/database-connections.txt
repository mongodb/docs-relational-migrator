Relational Migrator uses JDBC connection strings and associated user
credentials to access your relational database and MongoDB deployment.
You can save this information as a database connection.

Get Started
-----------

To save a new database connection, perform one of these actions:

- Create a project from a live database connection.

- Create or modify a data migration job.

- Navigate to the :guilabel:`Database Connections Bar` in a project.

- Navigate to the Relational Migrator :guilabel:`Connections` page.

After you save a database connection, you can use it for any 
task that requires connecting to a database.

Supported Alternatives
----------------------

If you don't have a live connection to your relational database, you can 
use the following options to create projects and map schemas:

- Relational Migrator can use Data Definition Language (DDL) files exported from 
  your relational database to create a project.

- Relational Migrator provides a pre-defined relational database schema you can use 
  to create a project.

.. note::

   Relational Migrator requires live database connections to perform data migrations.

For more information, see :ref:`Additional Connection Options <rm-additional-connection-options>`.
