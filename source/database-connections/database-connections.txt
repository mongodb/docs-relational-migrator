Relational Migrator uses JDBC connection strings and associated user
credentials to access your relational database and MongoDB deployment.
You can save this information as a database connection.

Relational Migrator can also use Data Definition Language (DDL) files 
exported from your relational database, and provides a sample relational 
database schema. For more information, see :ref:`rm-database-connections`.

Use Cases
---------

You can save connection settings for relational and MongoDB databases
when creating :ref:`projects <rm-projects>`` and :ref:`migration jobs <rm-sync-jobs>`. 
You can use these saved database connections for any task that requires 
connecting to a relational or MongoDB database.

Get Started
-----------

To create, view, and manage saved connections, go to the Relational 
Migrator :guilabel:`Connections` tab.
