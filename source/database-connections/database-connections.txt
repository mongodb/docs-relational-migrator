You can save connection settings for both relational and MongoDB databases on
the Relational Migrator :guilabel:`Connections` page. You can use saved
connection information for any task that requires connecting to a relational or
MongoDB database. Saving a Database Connection lets you maintain an "active"
connection as the default while working in your project.

You can also save connection information as a :ref:`connection string
<rm-connection-strings>`, but doing this doesn't add it to the
:ref:`Database Connections Bar <rm-project-overview>`.
