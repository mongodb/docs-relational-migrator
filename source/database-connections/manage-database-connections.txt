You can copy, edit, or delete database connections from the Relational Migrator
:guilabel:`Connections` page. Saved connections are listed by their environment
tag. You can mouse over the :icon-fa5:`info-circle` icon for a connection to
see a list of projects that use that connection.

Copy a Connection
-----------------

You can copy an existing connection. This can be useful if you want multiple
connections to the same server that each connect to different databases.

Copying a connection creates a duplicate with ``-Copy`` appended to the
connection name.


Steps
~~~~~

To copy a connection:

#. Click the :icon-fa4:`copy` button.

#. Make any desired changes.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`.



Edit a Connection
-----------------

You can edit an existing connection to change any settings except for the
database type. This can be useful for:

- Renaming the connection
- Adding changing, or removing the :guilabel:`Environment tag`
- Changing authentication credentials or SSL settings

If the connection is active in a project, this has the following impact:

- (effects on mapping rules)
- (effects on data migration jobs)


Steps
~~~~~

To edit a connection:

#. Click the :icon-lg:`Edit` button.

#. Make desired changes.

#. Click :guilabel:`Save`.



Delete a Connection
-------------------

You can delete a connection that you no longer need.


Steps
~~~~~

To delete a connection:

#. Click the :icon-fa5:`trash` button.

   A warning dialog appears and lists any projects that use the connection.

#. Click :guilabel:`Delete` to confirm.
