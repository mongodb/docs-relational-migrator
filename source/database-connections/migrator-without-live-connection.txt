If you don't have a live connection to a relational database, you can 
load a schema from a :abbr:`DDL (Data Definition Language)` file or use 
Relational Migrator's pre-defined sample schema.

Use Cases
---------

You can create a project without a live connection to a relational database 
to visualize and model your data, or to evaluate Relational Migrator. However,
Relational Migrator requires a live database connection to migrate data.

Load a Schema From a DDL File
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can visualize and model your data by loading a schema from a DDL file.
When you are ready to migrate data, you can use the data model you created 
by :ref:`exporting your project file <export-project>`. 

Use a Sample Schema
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can try Relational Migrator without a relational database by using the 
pre-defined ``Northwind`` sample schema. If you want to run a migration job 
using the sample schema, you can deploy a Docker image containing the sample 
schema and data.
