You can use a saved connection for any task that requires connecting
to a database. You can save a new MongoDB connection:

- When creating or modifying a :ref:`data migration job <rm-create-jobs>`
- From the Database Connections bar in a project
- From the Relational Migrator :guilabel:`Connections` page

To start a migration job, Relational Migrator must connect to your MongoDB
database using an account with :authrole:`readWrite` access. 

Before you Begin
----------------

- To save a connection to a MongoDB Atlas cluster, you must be :ref:`logged in <rm-atlas-log-in>` with Atlas.

- For both Atlas and on-premises deployments, create a separate
  :ref:`MongoDB user <rm-mongodb-service-user>` for Relational Migrator with
  :authrole:`readWrite` access to your MongoDB database.

Steps
-----

To save a new connection from the :guilabel:`Connections` page:

.. procedure::

   .. step:: Add a new connection
      
      In the list of :guilabel:`MongoDB` connections, click :guilabel:`+ Add connection`.

   .. step:: Enter the MongoDB connection string

      a. In :guilabel:`MongoDB connection string (URI)`, enter
         your :manual:`MongoDB URI <mongodb-uri>`.

      #. If it isn't included in the connection string, enter the
         :guilabel:`Database` to connect to.
      
      #. If they aren't included in the connection string, enter the 
         :guilabel:`Username` and :guilabel:`Password` of your
         :ref:`Relational Migrator MongoDB user <rm-mongodb-service-user>`.
         
         Checking :guilabel:`Save password` saves the password securely
         on your machine, so you don't have to enter the :guilabel:`Username`
         and :guilabel:`Password` again when using the saved connection.
      
      If you leave the :guilabel:`Database`, :guilabel:`Username`, 
      or :guilabel:`Password` blank, Relational Migrator uses the
      values from the URI.

   .. step: Identify the connection

      Enter a :guilabel:`Connection name` and optional :guilabel:`Environment tag`.
         
      Environment tags color code and organize connections for 
      convenience. Leaving the drop-down empty is the same as selecting 
      the "None" tag.

   .. step:: (Optional) Click :guilabel:`Test connection`

      Relational Migrator attempts to authenticate and connect to the
      database.
         
   .. step:: Click :guilabel:`Save`
      
      The saved connection is available for use in all jobs and projects.
