Working with Entities
=====================

After you :ref:`rm-create-project-live`, Relational Migrator creates an 
initial diagram containing the entities and relationships in 
the Relational and MongoDB models. The term "entity" refers to either a table in 
the relational model, or a collection in the MongoDB model. You can move and 
modify entities to customize your initial diagram and create additional diagrams.

You can work with entities in the following ways:

- :ref:`rm-select-entities`
- :ref:`rm-move-entities`
- :ref:`rm-copy-entities`
- :ref:`rm-toggle-visibility-entities`
- :ref:`rm-delete-entities`
