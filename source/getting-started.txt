Relational Migrator is a tool to help migrate your relational data to MongoDB.
This page provides an overview of Relational Migrator's :ref:`key features <rm-key-features>`, 
:ref:`use cases <rm-use-cases>`, :ref:`migration scenarios <rm-migration-scenarios>`, 
and :ref:`supported databases and versions<supported-databases>`.

.. _rm-key-features:

Key Features
------------

Map and Model Data
''''''''''''''''''

Relational Migrator uses entity-relationship diagrams to map your relational schema 
to a MongoDB schema, and can generate a recommended mapping to use as a starting 
point for your migration. For more information, see :ref:`<rm-mapping-rules>`.

Migrate to MongoDB
''''''''''''''''''

Relational Migrator helps you migrate data from 
:ref:`supported relational databases <supported-databases>` to MongoDB Atlas or 
a self-managed MongoDB deployment.


Generate Application Code
'''''''''''''''''''''''''

Relational Migrator generates MongoDB-compatible C#, Java, and JavaScript application code
for entity classes, persistence layers, and APIs. 

Code generation templates support JSON output and common application frameworks like 
Spring Data, Node, Mongoose. For more information, see :ref:`<rm-code-generation-templates>`.


Convert and Validate SQL Objects
''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Relational migrator uses generative AI to :ref:`convert <rm-query-converter>` SQL queries, 
views, and stored procedures into MongoDB-compatible code for C#, Java, or JavaScript.

You can test queries within Relational Migrator to validate converted SQL and 
ensure compatibility with MongoDB.

.. _rm-use-cases:

Use Cases
---------

Relational Migrator supports both Snapshot and Continuous migration jobs.

.. include:: /includes/fact-short-sync-job-desc.rst

Some relational databases are only compatible with Snapshot migration jobs.
For more information, see the table below.

.. include:: /includes/table-supported-migration-types.rst

.. _rm-migration-scenarios:

Migration Scenarios
-------------------

Supported Scenarios
'''''''''''''''''''

You can use Relational Migrator to migrate one legacy application at a
time to MongoDB. Depending on your application's needs, you can migrate
either with or without downtime.

.. include:: /includes/table-supported-migration-scenarios.rst

Unsupported Scenarios
'''''''''''''''''''''

Relational Migrator currently does not support migrating an operational
data store. Depending on your workload, migrating a data store could
cause :abbr:`CDC (Change Data Capture)` to run indefinitely without
completing, which is not recommended with Relational Migrator.

Relational Migrator will support more migration scenarios and use cases
in future releases.

.. _supported-databases:

Supported Databases and Versions
--------------------------------

Source Databases and Versions
'''''''''''''''''''''''''''''

Relational Migrator supports the following source databases:

.. include:: /includes/table-supported-dbs-and-versions.rst
