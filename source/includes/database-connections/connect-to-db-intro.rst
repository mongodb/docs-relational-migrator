You can save a new |db-type| database connection:

- When :ref:`creating a new project from a live database connection <rm-create-project-live>`
- When creating or modifying a :ref:`data migration job <rm-create-jobs>`
- From the Database Connections bar in a project
- From the Relational Migrator :guilabel:`Connections` page

After saving a database connection, you can use the saved connection 
for any task that requires connecting to a database.
