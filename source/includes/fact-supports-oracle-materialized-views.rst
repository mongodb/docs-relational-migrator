.. note::

   If you use an Oracle relational database, Relational Migrator supports 
   materialized views. Oracle materialized views can be used as tables 
   when creating projects and mapping rules. For information about materialized 
   views in Oracle, see the `Oracle SQL Language Reference <https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/sqlrf/CREATE-MATERIALIZED-VIEW.html>`__.

   For all other relational databases, materialized views are not supported.
