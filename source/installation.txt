Supported Deployment Models
---------------------------

The following table describes Relational Migrator's supported deployment models  
and the recommended migration scenario for each deployment model:

.. list-table::
   :header-rows: 1
   :widths: 15 35 20 30

   * - Deployment Model

     - Description

     - Use Cases

     - Details

   * - Local

     - Install Relational Migrator to a single machine that cannot 
       be externally accessed.

       For more information, see :ref:`<local-machine-install>`.
      
     - 
       - Evaluation
       - Data Modeling
       - Testing

     - Evaluation and small production jobs expected to run for less than a day. Note 
       that larger migrations can be broken down into separate jobs using 
       :ref:`table filters <rm-table-filters>`.
    
   * - Docker

     - Install Relational Migrator in a way that is simple to replicate
       and independent of the operating system.

       For more information, see :ref:`<rm-install-docker>`.
      
     - 
       - Evaluation

     - Intended for quick evaluation. Docker installation is not recommended
       for production workloads as it may not provide a resilient production 
       environment.
       

   * - Unattended server

     - Install Relational Migrator on an unattended server that binds Relational 
       Migrator to an IP address and port and exposes it as a web application.
       
       For more information, see :ref:`<unattended-server>`.

     - 
       - Testing
       - Smaller (<100GB) Migrations

     - Suitable for the majority of use cases, including tests and small production migrations. 
       Note that installing as an unattended server is not a highly-availably solution, and 
       users may need to intervene in the event of an application issue.
      

   * - Kafka

     - `Apache Kafka <https://kafka.apache.org/>`__ is an open-source platform for distributed 
       workloads.

       Use Relational Migrator as a Kafka Connect plugin to improve resilience and scalibility
       of big data migration jobs.

       For more information, see :ref:`kafka-intro`.
    
     - 
       - Mission Critical Migrations
       - Long Running Migrations

     - Critical production workloads and/or long-running :abbr:`CDC (Change Data Capture)` syncs.
       Using Relational Migrator with Kafka enables high availability and automatic failure 
       recovery where supported by the underlying cluster configuration.

   * - Kafka with Confluent Cloud

     - `Confluent  <https://www.confluent.io/>`__ is a fully-managed Kafka hosting 
       provider run by the founders of Kafka. 

       Use APIs to add the newest Relational Migrator sink connectors to Confluent Cloud
       as managed connectors.

       For more information, see :ref:`install-confluent-kafka`.
    
     - 
       - Mission Critical Migrations
       - Long Running Migrations

     - Ideal for users that prefer a fully-managed cloud-based solution.
