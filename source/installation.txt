   * - Deployment Model

     - Description

   * - Local

     - Suitable for evaluation and proof of concept jobs. For more information, 
       see :ref:`Install on a Single Machine <single-machine-install>`. 

   * - Unattended server

     - Suitable for smaller production jobs. For more information, see 
       :ref:`Install on an Unattended Server <unattended-server>`

   * - Kafka

     - The Kafka deployment method is recommended for long-running CDC syncs and 
       large data migrations of more than 20GB. pache Kafka is an open-source platform 
       for distributed workloads, offering high availability and automatic recovery. 
       This option is the most advanced, and is intended for users who require 
       long-running or large production data syncs. For more information, see 
       :ref:`kafka-intro`.

   * - Kafka with Confluent Cloud

     - The Kafka with Confluent Cloud deployment is an option for users who want 
       the reliability of Kafka without having to manage their own cluster. 
       Confluent is a fully-managed Kafka hosting provider run by the founders of 
       Kafka. This mode is similar to Kafka mode except that it uses APIs to upload 
       the latest Relational Migrator sink connectors in the Confluent Cloud to be 
       used as a managed connector. For more information, see :ref:`install-confluent-kafka`.
