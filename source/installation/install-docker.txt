You can install Relational Migrator with Kafka in a containerized environment 
using Docker. This method configures Kafka and Zookeeper to store data locally 
in Docker containers. Mounted volumes can be used for persisting data when 
necessary in the event that a container stops running or is restarted. This 
installation method is not recommended for production workloads.

Before you Begin
----------------

You must have Docker installed on your computer. For more information, see the 
`Docker Documentation <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`__.
