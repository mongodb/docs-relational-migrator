You can install Relational Migrator with Kafka in a containerized environment 
using `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/engine/>`__. This method configures Kafka 
to store data locally in Docker containers. This deployment method is ideal for 
educational purposes. Use this if you are looking to learn and understand how to 
configure your own multi-server Kafka environment. 

.. note::

   This deployment method is not recommended for production workloads. 

About this Task
---------------

Docker volumes can be used for persisting data when necessary in the event 
that a container stops running or is restarted. For more information, see 
`Volumes <https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/>`__.

Before you Begin
----------------

You must have Docker installed on your computer. For more information, see  
`Install Docker Engine <https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/>`__.

   .. step:: Install a Kafka cluster

      Use the following ``docker-compose`` example to install a Kafka cluster.
      
      You can also use an existing cluster and provide configuration details to connect 
      your existing cluster.

      .. code-block::

         version: '3'
         services:
           kafka-1:
           image: quay.io/debezium/kafka:2.2
           ports:
             - 19092:9092
             - 19093:9093
           environment:
             CLUSTER_ID: oh-sxaDRTcyAr6pFRbXyzA
             BROKER_ID: 1
             KAFKA_CONTROLLER_QUORUM_VOTERS: 1@kafka-1:9093
             NODE_ROLE: controller,broker
           healthcheck:
             test: ["CMD-SHELL", "./bin/kafka-topics.sh --version"]
             interval: 5s
             timeout: 10s
             retries: 10

   .. step:: Install a Kafka Connect cluster

      Install a Kafka Connect cluster with the ``relational-migrator-connect`` image 
      from `public Amazon ECR <public.ecr.aws/v4d7k6c9/relational-migrator:latest>`__.

   .. step:: Install Relational Migrator

      You have two options for installing Relational Migrator:

      1. From the `download center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__, 
         select the appropriate Relational Migrator installer.

      #. Create a docker image using a Relational Migrator installer.

         For a complete example, you can download the following ``docker-compose``: 
         `Containerised kafka-connect cluster with Relational Migrator 
         <https://migrator-installer-repository.s3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/1.4.3/docker-compose-migrator-single-kafka.yml>`__.

   .. step:: If your source database is MySQL or Oracle, add their related drivers

      Relational Migrator uses the JDBC driver of the respective source database to read 
      database schema. It bundles SQL Server and PostgreSQL JDBC drivers. For MySQL and 
      Oracle, you must add their drivers to the following path:

      ``<path-to-installation>/mongodb-relational-migrator/lib/app/lib``
      
      - Oracle: `21.6.0.0 of odjbc11.jar from the Oracle 21c
        <https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-drivers-archive.html>`__
      - MySQL: `latest 8.0.x version, Platform Independent Version 
        <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/>`__
