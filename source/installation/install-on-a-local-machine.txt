You can install Relational Migrator on a single machine. The single machine 
installation provides a simplified installation process and uses default settings.
This installation method is a "local" install because Relational Migrator 
cannot be externally accessed and is bound to a single IP and port. 

Use Cases
---------

Installing Migrator on a single machine is ideal for small developmental projects 
that do not require not external access. 

Behavior
--------

The JDBC drivers must be downloaded separately, and placed into a dedicated 
directory after Relational Migrator is installed. This is required to connect to 
your relational database. The JDBC driver directory is operating system specific 
and included in the installation instructions below.

If you are migrating from a MySQL database:

- Download the `latest 8.3.x version, Platform Independent Version <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/>`_.

- Unzip the downloaded file and copy the ``.jar`` file into the target folder.

If you are migrating from an Oracle database:

- Download `21.6.0.0 of ojdbc11.jar from the Oracle 21c <https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-drivers-archive.html>`_. 

- (Optional) To migrate tables that contain the ``XMLType`` type, you must also download the 
  `xdb.jar <https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-drivers-archive.html>`__ driver. 

If you are migrating from a DB2 database:

- Download `db2jcc.jar for DB2 <https://www.ibm.com/support/pages/db2-jdbc-driver-versions-and-downloads>`_.
