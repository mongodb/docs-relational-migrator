You can install Relational Migrator on a single Ubuntu or Debian machine. This 
installation method uses default settings and binds Relational Migrator to a single 
IP and port. 

Steps
-----

1. Download the latest ``.deb`` binary from the 
   `release page <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__.

#. Install Relational Migrator.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo apt install ./mongodb-relational-migrator_X.X.X-1_amd64.deb

#. Change the directory to the Relational Migrator ``app/lib`` location.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/lib/app/lib

#. (Optional) To connect to Oracle or MySQL drivers, download and place the drivers 
   into your Relational Migrator directory.

   a. To download and install MySQL, Oracle or DB2 drivers, see the following:

      .. include:: /includes/fact-driver-download-locations.rst

   b. Copy the driver files to ``/opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/lib/app/lib``.
