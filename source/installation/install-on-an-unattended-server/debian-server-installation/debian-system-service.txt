When you install Relational Migrator on a Debian server, you can also set up 
Relational Migrator to run as a system service. By running Relational Migrator as 
a system service, Relational Migrator automatically starts when the server starts.

Steps
-----

1. Create a ``/etc/systemd/system/migrator.service`` file. 

   Copy the text below into the ``/etc/systemd/system/migrator.service`` file. Replace 
   the binary path as needed.

   .. code-block::

      [Unit]
      Description=MongoDB Relational Migrator

      [Service]
      ExecStart="/opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin/MongoDB Relational Migrator

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target

#. Reload ``systemd`` to read the newly created service.

   .. code-block::

      systemctl daemon-reload

#. Enable the Relational Migrator service to automatically start when the server starts. 

   You can manage the service with the following ``systemctl`` commands: 

   .. code-block::

      systemctl enable migrator.service

      systemctl start migrator.service
