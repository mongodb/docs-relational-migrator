You can install Relational Migrator on an unattended server on both Linux 
and Windows systems. The unattended server installation binds Relational 
Migrator to any IP and port on the server and exposes it as a web application.

Use Case
--------

Installing Relational Migrator on an unattended server is ideal for larger 
production-scale migration projects.

Behavior
--------

- It is recommended that the unattended server installation is supplemented with 
  TLS/SSL configuration because Relational Migrator can be bound to any IP and port on 
  the server.

- When you install Relational Migrator on an unattended server, you can set up 
  Relational Migrator to run as a system service. As a system service, Relational 
  Migrator automatically starts when the server starts.

- When you install Relational Migrator on an unattended server, you can enable 
  external access to Relational Migrator on Windows. By enabling external access, 
  incoming connections are allowed on the same port as Relational Migrator.
