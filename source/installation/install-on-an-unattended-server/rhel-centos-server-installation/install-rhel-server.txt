You can install {+rel-mig+} on a RHEL/CentOS server. This installation 
method allows {+rel-mig+} to run on an unattended server. By running on an 
unattended server, {+rel-mig+} binds to any IP and port on the server 
and is exposes it as a web application.

Steps
-----

1. Download the latest ``.rpm`` binary from the `release page <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__.

#. Install {+rel-mig+}.

   .. code-block:: bash

      sudo yum install mongodb-relational-migrator-X.X.X-1.x86_64.rpm

#. (Optional) To connect to Oracle or MySQL drivers, download and place the drivers 
   into your {+rel-mig+} directory. 

   a. To download and install MySQL or Oracle drivers, see the following:

      - `MySQL: latest 8.3.x version, Platform Independent Version <https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/>`_

      - `Oracle: 21.6.0.0 of ojdbc11.jar from the Oracle 21c <https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html>`_

   b. Copy the driver files to ``/opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/lib/app/lib``.

      To copy the driver, use the following example:

      .. code-block:: bash
        
         curl https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/otn_software/jdbc/216/ojdbc11.jar -O -L -b -o

   For more information, see :ref:`Install on a Local Machine <local-machine-install>`.

#. Change the directory to the {+rel-mig+} ``/bin`` location and start the application.

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin
      
      ./mongodb-relational-migrator

#. Enable {+rel-mig+} to run as an unattended standalone server.

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment ``spring.profiles.active: unattended``. 

#. (Optional) Update TLS/SSL configuration properties.

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment and update TLS/SSL configuration 
   properties.

   It is recommended that the unattended server installation is supplemented with 
   TLS/SSL configuration because {+rel-mig+} can be bound to any IP and port on 
   the server. For additional information, see `SSL Configuration Properties <https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/docs/2.8.4/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-security-enabling-https>`__.

#. (Optional) Update the port that {+rel-mig+} runs on.

   By default, {+rel-mig+} is configured to run on port 8278.
   To change the port {+rel-mig+} runs on, update the ``server.port`` line 
   in your ``user.properties`` file to specify your preferred port.

#. Run {+rel-mig+} using the binary.

   The ``bin`` directory can typically be found at ``/opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin``.

   To run {+rel-mig+} using the binary, run the following:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd /opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin

      ./mongodb-relational-migrator

#. (Optional) Check logs for errors or other information. 

   - The logs are located in ``~/Migrator/Logs/migrator.log``.

   - When running {+rel-mig+} as a system service, the path is under 
     the service userâ€™s home directory.
