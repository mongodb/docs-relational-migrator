When you install {+rel-mig+} on a RHEL/CentOS server, you can also 
set up {+rel-mig+} to run as a system service. By running {+rel-mig+} as 
a system service, {+rel-mig+} automatically starts when the server starts.

Steps
-----

1. Create a ``/etc/systemd/system/migrator.service`` file. 

   Copy the text below into the ``/etc/systemd/system/migrator.service`` file. 
   Replace the binary path as needed. 

   .. code-block::

      [Unit]
      Description=MongoDB {+rel-mig+}

      [Service]
      ExecStart="/opt/mongodb-relational-migrator/bin/MongoDB {+rel-mig+}"

      [Install]
      WantedBy=multi-user.target

#. Reload ``systemd`` to read the newly created service:

   .. code-block::
      
      systemctl daemon-reload

#. Enable the {+rel-mig+} service to run on startup and start for the current session.

   You can manage the service with ``systemctl`` commands. To run on startup and 
   start the current session, run the following:

   .. code-block::

      systemctl enable migrator.service

      systemctl start migrator.service
