Install {+rel-mig+} to run as an unattended server on Windows. By running 
as an unattended server, {+rel-mig+} binds to any IP and port on the server 
and is exposes it as a web application.

Steps
-----

1. Log in to the server.

   You can log into the server interactively or using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
   For more information on logging into the server using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP),
   see `Connect to your Windows Instances using RDP <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/WindowsGuide/connecting_to_windows_instance.html#connect-rdp>`__. 

#. Download the {+rel-mig+} ``.msi`` installer. 

   Download the {+rel-mig+} ``.msi`` installer to the target machine or 
   remotely copy it over to the instance. Find the latest {+rel-mig+} 
   installer on the `release page <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__.

#. Launch the installer and follow the local machine :ref:`install instructions <local-machine-install>`. 

#. Enable {+rel-mig+} to run as an unattended server.

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment ``spring.profiles.active: unattended``. 
   Your ``user.properties`` file is located in 
   ``C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\mongodb\{+rel-mig+}\Data``.

#. (Optional) Update TLS/SSL configuration properties.

   In your ``user.properties`` file, uncomment and update TLS/SSL configuration properties.

   It is recommended that the unattended server installation is supplemented with 
   TLS/SSL configuration because {+rel-mig+} can be bound to any IP and port on 
   the server. For additional information, see `TLS/SSL Configuration Properties <https://docs.spring.io/spring-cloud-skipper/docs/2.8.4/reference/htmlsingle/#configuration-security-enabling-https>`__.

#. (Optional) Update the port that {+rel-mig+} runs on.

   By default, {+rel-mig+} is configured to run on port 8278.
   To change the port {+rel-mig+} runs on, update the ``server.port`` line 
   in your ``user.properties`` file to specify your preferred port.

#. Run {+rel-mig+} from its installed location or any shortcuts that were 
   created during the installation process. 

#. (Optional) Check logs for errors or other information. 

   - The logs are located in ``C:\Users\<Username>\AppData\Local\mongodb\{+rel-mig+}\Data\Logs``.
 
   - When running {+rel-mig+} as a system service, the path is under the 
     service user’s home directory. The local system user’s profile is located 
     at ``C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile``.
