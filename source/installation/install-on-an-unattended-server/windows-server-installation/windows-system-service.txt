When you install Relational Migrator on a Windows server, you can set up Relational 
Migrator to run as a system service. By running Relational Migrator as a system 
service, Relational Migrator automatically starts when the server starts.

Steps
-----

1. Launch the Service Manager of your choice.

   These steps use `NSSM <http://nssm.cc/>`__ (a free service manager utility).

#. From a command prompt, run ``.\nssm install RelationalMigrator``.

#. From the :guilabel:`Application` tab, choose the path and startup directory 
   of the installed ``MongoDB Relational Migrator.exe``.

#. From the :guilabel:`Details` tab, enter :guilabel:`MongoDB Relational Migrator` 
   as the serviceâ€™s display name.

#. From the :guilabel:`Log on` tab, keep the default local system account or 
   choose a specific account to run the service under.

#. Click :guilabel:`Install service`.

#. Launch ``services.msc``. 

   Find the newly installed MongoDB Relational Migrator service and click 
   :guilabel:`Start Service`. 

   .. note::

      When the startup mode is :guilabel:`Automatic`, the service starts automatically when 
      the computer next restarts.
