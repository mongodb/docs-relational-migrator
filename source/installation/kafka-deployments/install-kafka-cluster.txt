You can install Relational Migrator on an existing Kafka cluster including 
Kafka Connect. This installation method is ideal if you are already running 
Kafka or you have your own approach to installing and configuring Kafka.

.. important::

   This tutorial assumes prior knowledge of Kafka and does not cover the 
   setup, configuration, or operational management of a Kafka cluster.
   Providing support for setting up or operating a Kafka cluster is beyond 
   the purpose of this guide and the scope of MongoDB Support. 

Before you Begin 
----------------

You must have Kafka and network connectivity to the Kafka Connect cluster 
from the computer running Relational Migrator.

   .. step:: Install Debezium Source Connect Plugin

      a. Download the source connector archive for your source database:

         - `MySQL Connector plugin archive 
           <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-connector-mysql/{+connector-version+}.Final/debezium-connector-mysql-{+connector-version+}.Final-plugin.tar.gz>`__
         - `Postgres Connector plugin archive 
           <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-connector-postgres/{+connector-version+}.Final/debezium-connector-postgres-{+connector-version+}.Final-plugin.tar.gz>`__
         - `SQL Server Connector plugin archive 
           <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-connector-sqlserver/{+connector-version+}.Final/debezium-connector-sqlserver-{+connector-version+}.Final-plugin.tar.gz>`__ 
         - `Oracle Connector plugin archive 
           <https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/debezium/debezium-connector-oracle/{+connector-version+}.Final/debezium-connector-oracle-{+connector-version+}.Final-plugin.tar.gz>`__  

      b. Unzip the archive.

      c. Copy the ``debezium-connector.jar`` file to the ``debezium-connector`` directory.

         From the downloaded archive, copy the ``debezium-connector.jar`` file to the
         ``debezium-connector-xxx`` directory at Kafka Connect’s `plugin.path 
         <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connectconfigs_plugin.path>`__ on your 
         Kafka Connect cluster. For example: ``/kafka/connect/debezium-connector-sqlserver``.

      d. Restart your Kafka Connect cluster.

         When the  plugin is successfully registered, the following log statement 
         appears in the ``kafka-connect`` start up logs:

         .. code-block::
            :copyable: false

            INFO || Added plugin 'io.debezium.connector.sqlserver.SqlServerConnector'

   .. step:: Install the Relational Migrator Sink Connect Plugin

      a. Download the latest version of the ``kafka-connect-migrator.jar`` file.

         To download the latest ``kafka-connect-migrator.jar`` file, see the `Migrator Installer 
         Repository <https://migrator-installer-repository.s3.ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com/index.html>`__.

      b. Copy the ``.jar`` file to the ``kafka-connect-migrator`` directory.

         The new ``kafka-connect-migrator`` directory is found at Kafka Connect’s `plugin.path 
         <https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#connectconfigs_plugin.path>`__. For example: 
         ``/kafka/connect/kafka-connect-migrator``. 

      c. Restart your Kafka Connect cluster. 

         When the  plugin is successfully registered, the following log statement 
         appears in the ``kafka-connect`` start up logs:

         .. code-block::
            :copyable: false

            INFO || Added plugin 'com.mongodb.migrator.kafka.connect.MigratorSinkConnector'

   .. step:: Install Relational Migrator

      From the `download center <https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/relational-migrator>`__, 
      select the latest version of the Relational Migrator installer.

   .. step:: Run Relational Migrator in kafka-integrated mode

      To run in ``kafka-integrated`` mode, update the following configurations in your 
      ``user.properties`` file.

      Your ``user.properties`` file is located in an OS specific location. For more 
      information, see :ref:`Relational Migrator File Locations <file-location>`.

      .. include:: /includes/kafka-cluster-properties.rst

   .. step:: Confirm successful installation

      Start Relational Migrator and check the logs. Confirm that the Kafka profile 
      is active and that there are no errors.

      Your ``log`` file is located in an OS specific location. For more 
      information, see :ref:`Relational Migrator File Locations <file-location>`.
