Migration jobs are the worker processes responsible for transferring your 
data and schemas from a relational database to MongoDB. Create a new 
migration job from the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab.

.. include:: /includes/fact-kafka-supported-task.rst

About this Task
---------------

- The URI credentials you provide when creating a migration job do not 
  need to be the same as the credentials used when creating your project.

- You use an existing :ref:`Relational Database Connection
  <rm-save-relational-connection>`, or create one when you create the migration job.

.. include:: /includes/fact-kafka-additional-time.rst

- .. include:: /includes/fact-cdc-recoverable.rst

Before you Begin
----------------

- :ref:`Create one or more mapping rules <create-rule-relational>` in your 
  Relational Migrator project.
- For both Atlas and on-premises deployments, create a separate
  :ref:`MongoDB user <rm-mongodb-service-user>` for Relational Migrator with
  :authrole:`readWrite` access to your MongoDB database.

Steps
-----

.. procedure::

  .. step:: On the :guilabel:`Data Migration` tab, click :guilabel:`Create Migration Job`
 
    Relational Migrator only runs one migration job at a time. If a job is in 
    progress, this button is disabled.

  .. step:: Enter the relational database connection details

     On the :guilabel:`Connect to your source database` form, enter the
     connection details to create the JDBC URI for your relational database. 
      
     To use a saved :ref:`relational database connection <rm-save-relational-connection>`, 
     click :guilabel:`Use a saved connection`
     and select it from the drop-down, then enter credentials if required.
      
     To create a new connection:

     .. include:: /includes/steps-create-relational-connection-short.rst

  .. step:: Enter MongoDB connection details 

     To use a saved :ref:`MongoDB connection <rm-save-mongodb-connection>`,
     click :guilabel:`Use a saved connection` and select it from the 
     drop-down, then enter credentials if required.
      
     To create a new connection:

     .. include:: /includes/steps-create-mongodb-connection-short.rst

  .. step:: On the :guilabel:`Migration Options` form, select :guilabel:`Migration Options`:

      .. list-table::
        :header-rows: 1

        * - Migration Option
          - Description
        * - Mode 
          - Defines the type of migration job.
        * - Drop destination collections before migration
          - Boolean. Indicates whether Relational Migrator drops a 
            destination collection before transferring data. 
        * - Stop after errors 
          - Integer. Indicates the number of errors after which Relational 
            Migrator stops the migration job.  
        * - Verify migrated data 
          - Boolean. If true, the sync engine checks the migrated data 
            against the source database. Only supported for snapshot mode.

      After you specify the job type on :guilabel:`Migration Options` 
      form, Relational Migrator conducts various checks to ensure that 
      the database is configured correctly. If a configuration is 
      missing, a banner displays indicating improper 
      database setup and provides a :guilabel:`Generate Script` button 
      for SQL script download.

      This script includes the required configuration statements 
      and additional instructions in the form of comments. 

      .. warning:: 

        Before proceeding with starting a migration job:

        1. Download the script. 
        2. Carefully review its contents.
        3. Execute the statements.
        4. Follow any commented manual steps.

  .. step:: Review and start your migration job

      On the :guilabel:`Review Summary` form, you can see details about 
      your migration job. These details include the type, the number of 
      tables and rows affected, and the estimated data size of the 
      migration job. To start your migration job, click :guilabel:`Start`. 

      .. note :: 
         
         For Kafka migration jobs, view deployment details by selecting the 
         job in the :guilabel:`History` pane on the 
         :guilabel:`Data Migration` screen and hovering
         over the icon next to the :guilabel:`Create Migration Job`
         button.
