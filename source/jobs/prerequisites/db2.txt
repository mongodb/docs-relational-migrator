.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Snapshot Jobs
      :tabid: enable-snapshot-jobs

      .. procedure::
         :style: normal

        .. step:: Download and install the JDBC driver

        .. step:: Create the ``ASNCDC`` schema

           CDC tracking schemas: regardless of whether CDC is requested, Debezium requires the ASNCDC schema to 
           be present in the database, as well as a specific table IBMSNAP_REGISTER with two columns.

           The following statements create the required structure:
           CREATE SCHEMA "ASNCDC";
           CREATE TABLE "ASNCDC"."IBMSNAP_REGISTER" (SYNCHPOINT INTEGER, CD_NEW_SYNCHPOINT INTEGER);
           The schema/tables can be left empty to satisfy the Debezium requirement. There is no negative impact in creating this empty table if it doesn’t already exist.
           This requirement is reflected in the product via the “pre migration” script - that is, the existence of the table will be checked automatically and if needed Relational Migrator will generate a .sql script for a DBA to run. 

   .. tab:: Continuous Jobs
      :tabid: enable-continuous-jobs

      Continuous jobs are not currently supported on DB2 connections.
