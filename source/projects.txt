To interact with {+rel-mig+}, you use a project. A project holds
configuration settings, mapping rules, and migration-specific details.

Use Cases
---------

You can create projects with or without a live connection to your relational 
database. Relational Migrator requires a live database connection to migrate 
data. However, you can create a project without a live database connection to 
visualize and model your data.

If you already created a Relational Migrator project, you can :ref:`import<import-project>`, 
:ref:`export <export-project>`, :ref:`delete <delete-project>`, and 
:ref:`rename <rename-project>` your project.

Get Started
-----------

- :ref:`rm-create-project-live`
- :ref:`<migrator-without-live-connection>`
- :ref:`<rm-manage-projects>`
