You can use {+rel-mig+} to import projects. Import a project when you 
want to collaborate on a shared project. You can also duplicate a project by 
:ref:`exporting <export-project>` the project and then importing it. 

About this Task
---------------

Be aware of the following information when you import projects:

- When you import projects, {+rel-mig+} only uses ``.relmig`` files.

- {+rel-mig+} rejects files for import and returns an error message in 
  the following conditions:
  
  - The format of the file cannot be determined or if critical information is 
    missing.
  
  - The file was exported from an unsupported version of {+rel-mig+}

  - The version number of the file is older than a well-defined minimum version. 

Steps
-----

1. On your :guilabel:`home page`, select :guilabel:`New Project`.

#. Select :guilabel:`Import an existing project`.

#. Choose a file, or drag and drop the ``.relmig`` file. 

#. Click :guilabel:`Import`.
