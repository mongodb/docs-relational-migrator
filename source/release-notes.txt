1.10.0 Changelog
----------------

*Released October 2, 2024*

New features:

- New bulk conversion UI and API for Query Converter to automatically 
  convert large numbers of SQL queries, views, and stored procedures. 
  See :ref:`rm-bulk-conversion`.
- Snapshot jobs now create top-level documents using a non-idempotent 
  bulk insert method. This improves performance.
- Added explicit control over idempotent behavior through the 
  ``migrator.engine.transform.idempotency: true`` setting in the 
  ``user.properties`` file.
- Internal indexes used for migration are automatically deleted
  after job completion. This improves performance.
- Updated SQL Server JDBC driver to the latest version.
- Added Basic Authentication support for Kafka.
- Added more detailed logging in the application's log file in the 
  event of migration errors.
- Simplified the structure of Java POJO classes in Code Generation.

Bug fixes:

- Fixed an issue where tables were deselected for import into a 
  project after filtering the table list.
- Fixed a UI issue with the Migration Job Log which prevented it 
  from being resized when it contained a large number of entries.
- Fixed an issue where remote API calls such as query conversions 
  were not routed through the system proxy.
- Fixed an issue where individual rows exceeding the 16MB document 
  limit caused the job to stop immediately, instead of continuing 
  up to the error threshold. 
- Fixed an issue where data verification was unable to detect some 
  issues caused by precision differences between source and target 
  data types.
- Fixed an issue where each query could be imported twice.
- Fixed an issue where converted queries sometimes used incorrect 
  paths for embedded mappings.

- Query Converter now allows you to test your relational and converted 
  queries and compare the results in the :guilabel:`Test Queries` pane.

  This setting can be unchecked in the SSL tab.

Fixes:

  jobs using Confluent Cloud.
- Fixed an issue where migration jobs failed to start for Postgres databases 
  when the credentials were supplied with query string parameters.

  tables were not treated as a composite key.

  was not ready if the preflight test failed to run.

  deleted.

  database when connected as a user who is not the owner.
